            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>

            <p>
              First coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI) broadly describes computer systems that have the ability to perform tasks that
              mimic human intelligence. Creating computer systems that can successfully reason, plan, represent knowledge, learn, process natural language and
              perceive are all major goals of active AI research. Artificial Intelligence can be categorized into two different types, or forms of intelligence:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>General AI</strong>, also known as <em>Strong AI</em> or <em>Full AI</em> is the canonical form of intelligence you’ll likely think about when you hear the
              term AI – this is your Skynet and Terminators. General AI would exhibit all of the characteristics of human intelligence, but is incredibly difficult
              to create and does not exist in any meaningful or material form today.  The creation of General AI systems is the ultimate goal for AI researchers, who reserve
              the term General AI for machines that are capable of experiencing consciousness.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Applied AI</strong>, also known as <em>Weak AI</em> or <em>Narrow AI</em> is the most prevalent form of AI today. Unlike General AI, Applied AI exhibits very limited
              and very specific characteristics of human intelligence, but can incredibly effective when applied to very specific types of problems. Concrete examples of
              Applied AI include facial recognition systems, personal digital assistants, spam filters and autonomous vehicles. This book covers the approaches, methods and
              algorithms used to develop Applied AI systems.
            </p>



            <a name="sec-2"></a>
            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>

            <p>
              Machine Learning (ML) is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed, and specifically focuses on the
              design and construction of algorithms that can both learn from and make predictions on data. Machine Learning is an approach towards achieving AI. A more formal definition
              of Machine Learning was produced by Tom Mitchell in 1998:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              A computer program is said to <strong>learn</strong> from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P,
              improves with experience E.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Simply put, if a computer program can improve the performance of a task by using previous experience, you can say that the program has learned from the experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              The ability for software to learn and improve from experience is significantly different from how traditional software is written. ML enables the development new
              types of applications that would either be impractical or impossible if the same application were to be programmed explicitly using traditional software engineering approaches.
            </p>



            <a name="sec-3"></a>
            <h2>Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning</h2>

            <p>
            There are generally considered to be three broad machine learning approaches or types that can be used depending on your objectives and the nature of problem you’re trying to solve.
            </p>

            <h3>Supervised Learning: Machines that learn to recognize relationships</h3>

            <p>
            Supervised learning is a machine learning approach that leverages existing pairs of input and output data, with an expectation that some form of relationship exists between the input and output. A supervised learning algorithm will be trained to identify relationships within an existing data set, and after training is complete the algorithm should  be able to identify relationships with novel data it has not been exposed to before.
            Spam filtering is a concrete example of supervised learning in practice. In this example, a data pair consists of an email as an input and a classification (spam mail or legitimate mail) as an output. We know that there is a relationship between an email and whether or not it’s considered spam – it could be the general language or specific words used in the email, the sender address or the number or types of links included in the email. There are a number of factors which will dictate whether an email is spam or not, and this is exactly what we want our algorithm to learn.
            To train a spam filtering algorithm,  it needs to be provided with sets of emails that are labeled as spam and sets of emails that are labelled as legitimate so that the algorithm can learn to identify the relationship between an email and it’s classification. With enough training data, the algorithm should be able to reliably identify an email as either legitimate or spam.
            Another way to think about supervised learning is that it helps to solve problems where you already know the right answers, but you don’t have a comprehensive set of rules or insights to drive the outcome you’re looking for.
            It’s relatively simple for a human to look at an email and decide whether it’s spam or not, but difficult to develop software with an explicit and concrete set of rules to achieve the same outcome. Supervised learning algorithms are incredibly effective in solving these classes of problems. This book will cover a number supervised learning algorithms in detail.
            </p>

            <h3>Unsupervised Learning: Machines that learn to discover patterns</h3>
            <p>
            Unsupervised learning is a useful approach for solving discovery problems. A supervised learning algorithm will be trained to identify known relationships in your data, whereas an unsupervised learning algorithm will attempt to discover unknown relationships in your data. Unsupervised learning algorithms allow you to discover patterns and structure in your data that would otherwise be impractical or impossible.
            Unsupervised learning algorithms are often used for grouping, clustering or segmenting data. If we used unsupervised learning for image recognition, we would provide the algorithm with a set of unlabeled images – in other words, we wouldn’t tell the algorithm what the images were. We would simply supply the images, and let the algorithm attempt to figure out what they were based on common characteristics that the algorithm discovers on its own.
            The algorithm wouldn’t be able to label a particular type of object – put simply, the unsupervised learning algorithm will not make predictions like “this is a cat”, “this is a dog” or “this is a person”. However, what the algorithm will do is recognize similar patterns in images and group them together accordingly - it will create distinct clusters for humans, cats and dogs, and will also recognize that the pattern for a cat is different from the pattern for a dog or human. After the clustering is complete, humans can inspect the results for insights and labelling.
            </p>

            <h3>Reinforcement Learning: Machines that learn from their environment</h3>
            <p>
            Reinforcement learning is a modern approach to machine learning that makes use of goal-oriented algorithms which learn how to accomplish an objective over many steps. For example, reinforcement learning algorithms are well suited to maximize the points won in a game over many moves. These algorithms are penalized when they make the wrong decisions and rewarded when they make the right ones, which is why these types of algorithms are called reinforcement learning algorithms.
            Reinforcement learning algorithms share the same discovery characteristic as unsupervised learning algorithms; neither are not provided with training data sets (i.e. the correct answers) ahead of time. In the absence of training data, reinforcement learning algorithms learn from experience by collecting data through trial-and-error; they sense and adapt to the environment around them.
            In this sense, reinforcement learning algorithms share a similar data-driven learning approach as supervised learning algorithms; while supervised learning algorithms learn from data ahead of time, reinforcement learning algorithms learn from data as it becomes available in their environment.
            The ability for software to sense, learn from, and then adapt to changes in an environment makes reinforcement learning algorithms well suited for advanced problems spaces like autonomous vehicle design, robotics and supply chain optimization.
            While we won’t be covering reinforcement learning in this book, we wanted to include a section on reinforcement learning so you can gain a bit of insight and appreciation around how reinforcement learning works. Reinforcement learning is an exciting and advanced area of research in Machine Learning, but still has a few practical challenges to overcome in order to successfully implement these types of algorithms in real-world applications.

            <h2>Predictive Models in Machine Learning</h2>

            <p>
            A number of predictive models are employed in machine learning to solve particular classes of problems. One of the first things you’ll need to do as an AI/ML designer is understand the specific problem space you’re working in, so that you can leverage the right predictive model and its associated machine learning algorithms to get the outcome you’re looking for.
            The predictive model that you choose will also be driven by the ML approach you’ve taken. Supervised learning will make use of classification or regression models, and unsupervised learning will make use of clustering or dimensionality reduction models.
            This section provides a brief overview of each predictive model and the problems they aim to solve; you’ll learn quite a bit more about these models in this book.
            </p>

            <h3>Classification: Assign membership to an object</h3>
            <p>
              Classification identifies group membership of an object by predicting a discrete value from a well-defined, finite set of possible outcomes. Put simply, classification algorithms identify the best group for an object, given all of possible groups the algorithm is allowed to choose from.
              Spam filtering is a concrete example of a classification problem. A spam filtering algorithm will have two possible options, or groups to choose from: a spam email group, or a legitimate email group. For every email (the object) we want the algorithm to choose, or identify the best group for the email out of the two options that are available – the email is either spam or legitimate.
            </p>

            <h3>Regression: Predict a continuous value</h3>
            <p>
              Regression estimates, or predicts a continuous value. A continuous value is a real value, such as an integer or floating point number. Regression algorithms will often predict quantities, such as amounts and sizes. For example, a house may be predicted to sell for a specific dollar value, or a stock may be predicted to rise to a specific price.
            </p>

            <h3>Clustering: Discover new patterns and relationships in your data</h3>
            <p>
              Clustering assigns objects to groups while ensuring that objects in different groups are not similar to each other. Clustering aims to discover the hidden patterns in, and structure of your data. Each object is described by a set features, or characteristics.
            </p>

            <h3>Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce the number of variables in your data</h3>
            <p>
            Dimensionality reduction reduces the number of object features or dimensions under consideration.
            Feature reduction can be achieved by feature selection, where a subset of features are selected from the existing features, or by feature extraction, where features are extracted by combining existing features.
